# Themelio

Themelio is a Go-based infrastructure management system that provides a simplified interface over cloud and on-premises infrastructure using the reconciliation pattern (similar to Kubernetes). It uses etcd as state storage and supports multiple cloud providers.

## Architecture

The project is organized into four main modules:

- **reconciler**: Core reconciliation logic and etcd integration
- **aws**: AWS provider implementation
- **gcp**: Google Cloud Platform provider implementation  
- **azure**: Microsoft Azure provider implementation

Each module is a separate Go module with its own `go.mod` file and can be developed independently.

```

## Getting Started

Each module can be built and run independently:

```bash
# Build and run the reconciler
cd reconciler
go build -o bin/reconciler cmd/main.go
./bin/reconciler

# Build and run AWS provider
cd aws
go build -o bin/aws cmd/main.go
./bin/aws

# Build and run GCP provider
cd gcp
go build -o bin/gcp cmd/main.go
./bin/gcp

# Build and run Azure provider
cd azure
go build -o bin/azure cmd/main.go
./bin/azure
```

## Resources

Currently, the following resources are planned:

- **Network**: Virtual network abstraction (VPC/VNet)
